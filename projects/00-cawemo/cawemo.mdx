In November 2018, I joined a company called [Camunda](https://camunda.com). Their primary specialty is everything related to business processes. One of their main products is a [BPMN Engine](https://camunda.com/products/camunda-bpm/bpmn-engine/) and a library JavaScript modeling library called [bpmn-js](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/) (both open-source).

Since joining, I have been part of a team of 6 people responsible for building Cawemo (short for Camunda Web Modeler). Imagine it like a combination of GitHub and Visio: a place in the cloud to create, manage, and design your companies' processes. Through plugins and connections with other Camunda products, these processes can then be integrated with the automated workflow engine.

Cawemo is a medium-sized [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) application that relies on [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) to manage its state. The application integrates many plugins and libraries, such as bpmn-js.

My role as part of the Frontend team is to implement new features, refactor the codebase, write tests, fix bugs, document changes, deploy new SaaS releases, and much more. Cawemo has undergone massive refactorings, with many of them being driven by myself. The team's goal is to improve the codebase continuously. Hence, there's hardly any place in the code I haven't touched.
