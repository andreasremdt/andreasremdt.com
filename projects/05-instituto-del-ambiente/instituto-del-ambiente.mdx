During my time as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic, I started work on this website for an environmental institute. The principal asked me to build something representing what the institution stands for: protecting our environment and educating young individuals.

I was pretty much independent regarding design, technologies, and content management, so I decided to approach this project using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/). It was my first [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) project, so naturally, I underwent a trial and error phase during development. After some time spent on learning and troubleshooting, I came up with a pretty solid architecture and launched the site in spring 2018.

The project is built with modern web technologies such as Flexbox and ECMAScript 2015, hosted on the [Netlify CDN](https://www.netlify.com/). Another great learning experience I had was my first use of the Atomic CSS approach with the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework. It was challenging initially, but it felt quite good after a while and led to satisfying results.

Unfortunately, due to my ending contract, I had no time to finish the project as I wanted to and passed the responsibility over to one of my colleagues.
