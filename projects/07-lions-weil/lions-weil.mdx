[Lions Clubs](https://www.lionsclubs.org/en) is a worldwide organization of volunteers that are committed to doing good. Donations, campaigns, and direct interactions with disabled people, minorities, and more are just a few examples of what Lions stand for. A local club from my hometown is part of this network and wanted a website.

This was one of my first side projects ever. I had hardly learned the basics of web development and wanted to gain new experiences. I worked on the site besides my main job and used it as a chance to improve my skills and myself.

The design was slightly inspired by Lions' global CI and is focused on a clean and straightforward presentation. The content speaks for itself, and the club uses this site to publish their activities and reach the local community.

The backend is powered by a powerful CMS called [Contao](https://contao.org/en/); After deploying to site to production, I also trained some of their members on managing content using Contao. The frontend is entirely self-written and designed from scratch.
