[Leo-Clubs](http://members.lionsclubs.org/EN/leos/index.php) is a worldwide organization of young volunteers who want to help those in need. With its roots coming from the U.S., this organization has spread across the entire planet and achieved incredible things for disabled people, children in need, and many more.

Since 2011 I'm a member of a local Leo-Club, helping together with others. When I entered the club, its existing website was outdated, with almost no design and undocumented PHP code. Together with another member, I decided to redo the entire site in 2013 using WordPress.

In 2018, it was time again for a new design and to lift the website into the latest web standards. This time, I decided to refrain from using any backend language and instead went with the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

The website is written in clean HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any dependencies. Hosting was solved thanks to [Netlify's CDN](https://www.netlify.com/), protected by a SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). To allow content editing for other members, I went with [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) as a static CMS.

The website can be viewed on any device and resolution, using lazy-loading and code minification to improve page speed and user experience.
