During my time as a volunteer in the Dominican Republic, I started work on this website, which presents the institute I was working for. The principal asked me to build something that can represent what the institution stands for: protecting our environment and educating young individuals.

I was pretty much independent regarding design, technologies and content management, so I decided to approach this project using Jekyll and [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This was my first project using the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, so naturally, I underwent a phase of trial and error. After some time spent on learning and troubleshooting, I came up with a pretty solid architecture and was able to launch the site in spring 2018.

The project is built with modern web technologies such as Flexbox and ECMAScript 2015, hosted on the [Netlify CDN](https://www.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Another great learning experience I had was my first use of the [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} approach with the [Tailwind CSS Framework](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. It was challenging at the beginning, but after a while, it felt quite good and let to satisfying results.

Unfortunately, there was no time for me to finish the project as I wanted to, so it still uses a custom Netlify subdomain and lacks some content.
