In 2014, someone asked me if I could make him a website for his private renting property in the Black Forest. I accepted and developed a single-page website using Wordpress. That website was rather simple, only having some text, an image gallery and a contact form with a calendar embedded to show vacancies.

4 years later, in 2018, I rebuilt the entire website from scratch. It still uses [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, as the client is now used to it and appreciates the easy workflow.
The new site design fits much better into the rustic and wooden theme of the hut, presenting itself in dark colors and with a goldish accent. It still is a single-page website, but now offers more sections and content, such as the furnishing, a location map, and a vacancy calendar.

Visitors are now able to see a vacancy calendar and can directly enter their data to book the hut. It calculates the costs automatically based on the period of time and informs the hut's owner once sent.

Technically, the entire website has seen a major update. It is now served using HTTPS and with the latest version of Wordpress. For security reasons, almost no plugins were used. The theme itself is hand-crafted and does exactly what the client asked for. It uses Flexbox and modular JavaScript to ensure a smooth user interaction and works on all screen sizes and devices.
