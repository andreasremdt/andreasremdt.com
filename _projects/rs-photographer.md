A friend of mine, with whom I studied at the time, asked me if I could build him a personal portfolio to showcase his photos. He is a very talented photographer taking photos for clients on weddings and other occasions.

The focus of his website clearly were the photos, so we stuck to a rather simple design in black & white and let the photos speak for themselves. Because he wanted to maintain the website with new content I integrated the [Contao](https://contao.org/en/){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} CMS so he would be able to do so.

The frontend is written in plain HTML and CSS, using jQuery and [Fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} to display the beautiful photos. The entire site is completely responsive and uses caching to speed up page loading.
