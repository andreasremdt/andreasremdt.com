This was a small side project I did for the [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"} curriculum. The goal was to develop a weather app that displays the current climate based on the geolocation.

I took an existing design from Dribbble and implemented it using [Codepen](https://codepen.io/){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}. It uses the latest CSS technologies and might not work in all browser, thus being a concept only.
