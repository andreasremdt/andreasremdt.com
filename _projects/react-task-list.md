My first *real* project in React. I used this project to learn React and to get some experience with the framework. It's a rather simple task list that stores the user's tasks in the browser's localStorage. Tasks can be marked as done and will be moved to the bottom. Features are:

* Add and delete as many tasks as you want.
* Tasks contain a title and a date.
* Tasks are sorted by date and whether they are completed or not. Completed tasks are below, open tasks on top.
* Tasks are persisted in your browser using localStorage.
* Shows the number of open tasks on top.

The layout is done with plain Flexbox, as the UX is pretty straight-forward.
