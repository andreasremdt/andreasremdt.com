The Lions Club is a worldwide organization of volunteers that is committed to do good. Donations, campaigns and direct interactions with disabled people, minorities and more. A local club from my hometown is part of this network and needed a new website.

The design was slightly inspired by the global CI and is focused on a clean and straight-forward presentation. The content speaks for itself, and the club uses this site to publish their activities and to reach local people. The backend is powered by a powerful CMS called [Contao](https://contao.org/en/){:rel="noopener"}{:target="_blank"}, the frontend is entirely self-written and designed.
