I recently moved my résumé from Google Docs to being an HTML page, giving me more creative and technical freedom. As part of that move, I wanted the résumé to be available in different languages.

Sure, I could go with a (server-side) templating language or a static site generator such as Jekyll to serve translated content, but I wanted to keep things simple and just rely on pure HTML and JavaScript.

This article describes how I implemented an i18n feature for my personal résumé without using any third-party libraries. This is most likely not the perfect solution for you or your project and might be missing some crucial logic, but maybe you’ll find it interesting anyway.

Not convinced yet? Here’s a working example:

## #1 — Imaging the API

It was clear that the translation should happen only in the front end, using nothing but plain JavaScript and HTML.
Before I start building such features, I like to figure out what the API should look like.

Say we have the following HTML:

```html
<h1>This is some English title</h1>
```

If we would like to translate this text, what would be the best way? In case you’ve worked with templating engines like [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) before, you might be familiar with this syntax:

```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
```

Once the templating engine executes this code, it replaces `title` with an associated value, provided by some sort of object. Alternatively, a function can be put in between the curly braces, like so:

```html
<h1>{{ i18n('title') }}</h1>
```

Somewhere in your code, there’d be a function `i18n()` that takes a key as a string and returns the proper translation. The templating engine executes this function each time it encounters it in the template, resulting in the translated HTML.

I like this approach since it’s clear and straight-forward. However, I didn’t want to include a fully-fledged template engine nor build one from scratch, so this idea didn’t work out for me. _If you have something like Handlebars already included in your app, go ahead and make use out of it._

Instead, I decided to go with [HTML data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes):

```html
<h1 data-i18n="title">This is some English title</h1>
```

Data attributes are part of the HTML specification and a great way to provide additional, custom data to HTML.
For each HTML element that we need to translate we would provide the `data-i18n` attribute with a key. In this very case, `title` is the key to look for in my translation files and will tell the translator what text to apply.

## #2 — The translation files

Now that we have a way to mark our HTML elements as translatable, we should create the translation files next. In my project, I decided to make a new folder `i18n` and put a `.json` file for each language inside:

```bash
i18n
|—— en.json
|—— de.json
|—— es.json
```

Inside the translation file it would look similar to this:

```json{numberLines: true}
{
  "greeting": "Hello World",
  "header": {
    "title": "This is the header text",
    "button": "Click me!"
  }
}
```

The structure across these files must be consistent! You can’t have a `header` property in one file and a `heading` for the same text in a different one. The only thing that can (and should) change is the actual text content.

The above code sample is quite simple. Check out [this file in my repository](https://github.com/andreasremdt/cv/blob/master/i18n/en.json) if you want to see a bigger example that’s actually in use.

## #3 — Building the translator

The last thing missing is the actual translator. Let’s get our hands dirty writing some JavaScript.

### The base class

We start by creating a new file called `translator.js` in our JavaScript directory.

The first thing to do is to create a new class called `Translator`:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
"use strict"

class Translator {
  constructor() {}
}

export default Translator
```

So far we have an empty class with a constructor (which is going to be useful in a second) which gets exported as the default. This means that from anywhere in our project we can import and use it like so:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
import Translator from "./translator.js"

new Translator()
```

### Determining the user’s language

One of the trickier things is to determine which language the user wants in the first place. If this was the server-side (e.g. Node.js), things would get a lot better by using the `Accept-Language` [HTTP Header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4), which contains an ordered, weighted list of preferred languages by the user. This header is sent by the browser.

Unfortunately, we are limited to the front end and don’t have access to headers. Instead, we need to rely on the `navigator.languages` array, which holds preferred languages based on browser settings.

Go ahead and open your browser’s dev tools, no matter if it’s Firefox, Chrome or any other, type `navigator.languages` and press `Enter`. It will most likely return a similar array:

```javascript
navigator.languages(4)[("en-US", "en", "de-DE", "de")]
```

With this information in place, we can write our first method in the `Translator` class:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
getLanguage() {
  var lang = navigator.languages ? navigator.languages[0] : navigator.language;

  return lang.substr(0, 2);
}
```

The first thing we do is to declare a variable `lang`. Its assigned value is going to depend on whether or not the `navigator.languages` array exists. In some older browsers it might not, so we want to have a proper fallback. In that case, `navigator.language` (note the missing “s”) is available to us, containing just a string like `en-US`.

However, the `navigator.languages` array should be available in most (modern) browsers, and if that’s the case, we get its first entry and assign it to `lang`.

The next thing to consider is that the language string might not always be in the same format. It can either be `en-US` or just `en`. We need to consider this when evaluating the string.

Therefore we only return the first 2 characters by using `substr(0, 2)`. If the value is `en-US`, only `en` gets returned. If the value was en in the beginning, well, then the return doesn’t change anything.

Let’s store this information in our `Translator` class. The best place to do so is inside the constructor:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
constructor() {
  this._lang = this.getLanguage();
}
```

### Loading the language files

Awesome progress, we now have the user’s preferred language. This means that we can load the associated language file and consume its data. Let’s add a new method to the `Translator` class:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
load(lang = null) {
  if (lang) {
    this._lang = lang;
  }
}
```

We accept a parameter `lang` for this method, since eventually the user is going to want to switch the language using a button or something. In that case, we’ll call `translator.load('en')` to translate the page. By default, however, the `lang` attribute is not set meaning that we use whatever is set in `this._lang` by our language detection from above.

Below that if-condition add the following code:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
fetch(`/i18n/${this._lang}.json`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((translation) => {
    // do something
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.error(`Could not load ${this._lang}.json.`));
  });
```

Using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) we head out to get the correct language file and process it as JSON. Its content is now available in the second `.then` callback.

_Note that if you didn’t place the `i18n` folder in the root of your project but rather a sub folder, you’ll need to change the path accordingly._

If the file doesn’t exist, the promise will fail and `.catch` is called, logging an error. At this point, we could talk about error handling, but let’s not worry about that for now.

Instead we assume that the file has been loaded and we have access to the object containing all of our texts. The next step is to actually translate the HTML page. Inside the `.then` callback function put the following code:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
.then((translation) => {
  this.translate(translation);
})
```

`this.translate` is a new method inside our `Translator` class, but we haven’t created it, yet:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
translate(translation) {
  ...
}
```

### Translating the page

But what does the `translate` method actually do? Basically, we need to:

- Loop through all HTML elements with a `data-i18n` attribute and get the translation key.
- Match the key with an entry in the translation file.
- Replace the HTML elements’ text with the found translation.

But we still don’t have a list of the HTML elements with a `data-i18n` attribute. Let’s go back into our classes’ constructor and add the following line of code:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
constructor() {
  this._lang = this.getLanguage();

  // This is new:
  this._elements = document.querySelectorAll("[data-i18n]");
}
```

All we do is to use `querySelectorAll` to select all elements with said attribute. A reference to a [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) is going to be stored in `this._elements`, making it accessible in the entire class.

Let’s get back to the `translate` method and add a `forEach` loop:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
translate(translation) {
  this._elements.forEach((element) => {
    ..
  });
}
```

All this does is to iterate over each element with a `data-i18n` attribute. Inside the callback function we can define what should happen to this element, so let’s continue:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
var keys = element.dataset.i18n.split(".")
var text = keys.reduce((obj, i) => obj[i], translation)

if (text) {
  element.innerHTML = text
}
```

So what in the world is actually going on here?

- On line 1 we declare a new variable named `keys`.
- `keys` gets assigned an array as a result of the `.split(".")` method. What we do is to split our values whenever a dot appears. For example, `data-i18n="header.title"` would result in the array `["header", "title"]`.
- The next line is perhaps the most difficult one because it involves `reduce`. To make it short, here we map our `keys` array to a property in the `translation` object and store its value.
- Then, and only if the key string matched anything in the object, we override the element’s HTML on line 5 with the new text from the translation file.

But let’s go back to line 2 for a second… “What does this even do?” I hear you asking. Stick with me.

The problem is that our data attribute is something like `header.title`. We now have to find the right property in the nested object, right?

```json{numberLines: true}
{
  "header": {
    "title": "The precious text to look for"
  }
}
```

You most likely are familiar with these two ways of accessing properties in objects:

```javascript
obj["title"]
obj.title
```

Well, unfortunately, neither works for us, because the object is nested. We can’t write `obj["header.title"]`, it would just return `undefined`.

That’s why we converted the string `header.title` into an array. With `.reduce`, we can now iterate over these two values in the array:

```javascript
["header", "title"].reduce((obj, i) => obj[i], translation);
```

- `reduce` runs once for every value in the array. In this example, it runs twice.
- The second parameter, `translation`, is the initial value of `obj`. This only holds true for the very first iteration.
- So the first time it runs, `obj` in the callback function is equal to the `translation` object and `i` is equal to `"header"`.
- In the callback function’s body, we just return `obj[i]`. In this case, it’s `obj["header"]`. This equals to the sub object `{ title: "The precious text to look for" }`. You could also write it like this to make it more explicit:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
["header", "title"].reduce(function (obj, i) {
  return obj[i]
}, translation);
```

- `reduce` accumulates values of an array. Since we returned `{ title: "The precious text to look for" }` in the first iteration, this is going to be the value of `obj` in the second iteration. The value of `i` this time is equal to `title`.
- We execute the function’s body the second time equally. Now we return `obj["title"]`, which, if you remember the object’s structure, returns the string of _“The precious text to look for”._
- Since this is the final iteration (we only have two items in the array), the `reduce` method returns this value and we store it in a variable called `text`.
- `text` is now equal to _"The precious text to look for"_.

Yeah, believe me, I didn’t get it in the beginning as well. `reduce` is still one of my biggest fears in JavaScript, but on the other hand, it’s so [incredibly useful](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reduce-f47a7da511a9/).

So, in the end, we archived our goal. We can call the method `load("en")` and it will load the appropriate translation from a folder and apply it’s contents to our HTML. Pretty neat, ain’t it?

### Changing the `lang` attribute

One of the last things we could do to improve the script is to update the `lang` attribute each time the language changes.

Let’s add a little method for that:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
toggleLangTag() {
  if (document.documentElement.lang !== this._lang) {
    document.documentElement.lang = this._lang;
  }
}
```

All this does is to change the `lang` attribute, which is set on the root element of your website:

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

## #4 — Some observations

- In the first iteration of this script, I didn’t use `fetch` to load the language files, but [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) (`import()`). After some feedback, I chose to change this because fetching the data is semantically more correct. JavaScript imports should rather be for modules and conditionally loaded logic, not resources.
- The attribute `data-i18n` can really be anything. If you don’t like this name, you can call it `data-translation` or whatever else you’d prefer and change the associated code in the constructor.
- I’m using `innerHTML` to override the text content upon translation. Some people might say that this is bad practice because it could lead to unsafe script execution in the HTML. While this argument holds true if you load data from a server or get it from a user (where you don’t know what you get), in this very case I know very well where the data is coming from and don’t have to fear any hidden `script` tag lingering inside. After all, I’m the one writing the translation files, not a stranger.
- In the beginning we wrote the `getLanguage` method, which detects the user’s preferred language. If you want to translate your site on load (without the user having to click on a button first), you can just call `translator.load()` (without passing any language parameter).

## Conclusion

And that’s it. If you want to use this script in your app, all you have to do is to import the `Translator` class, initialize it and call the `load()` method:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
import Translator from "./translator.js"

var translator = new Translator()
translator.load("de")
```

The call to `load` could be inside an event handler, for example after a user selects a language from a dropdown or presses a button. The implementation is completely up to you.

I have also created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andreasremdt/simple-translator/tree/v1.2) with a few additions like configuration, so it’s easier for you to use this library in your own project.
